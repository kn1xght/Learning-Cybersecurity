Topic: Linux Basics

I was surprised to learn how widely Linux is used, from PoS (Point of Sale) systems I’ve personally worked with in service jobs, to critical infrastructures such as traffic light controllers and industrial sensors.

Just like Windows has multiple versions (7, 8, and 10), Linux also comes in many distributions. The most common ones include Ubuntu, Debian, and Kali. 
The right distribution depends on your role — Ubuntu and Debian are typically used for general administration or blue-team (defensive) work, while Kali is geared toward offensive security and penetration testing.

The first release of Linux was in 1991.

One major advantage of Linux systems such as Ubuntu is that they’re lightweight and efficient. However, this also comes with a drawback: many versions don’t include a graphical user interface (GUI). 
Instead, most interaction happens through the terminal, which is entirely text-based.

BASIC COMMANDS:

echo — outputs any text that we provide
whoami — displays the username of the current user
ls — lists the contents of a directory
cd — changes the current directory
cat — displays or concatenates file contents
pwd — prints the current working directory

INTERMEDIATE COMMANDS:

find — performs a more sophisticated search than using only cd and ls
grep — searches through text or files for specific patterns; more targeted than cat

LINUX OPERATORS:

& — runs commands in the background of your terminal
&& — chains multiple commands together in one line, executing the next only if the previous succeeds
> — redirects command output to a file (overwrites existing content)
>> — redirects command output to a file but appends instead of overwriting

Takeaway:
I now understand that Linux is a powerful, lightweight, and widely used operating system that’s essential for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity work. 
I’m becoming comfortable navigating the terminal and using basic commands to move around and manipulate files.
